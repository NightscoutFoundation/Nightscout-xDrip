# Mobile Phones that are compatible using Dexcom G5 & G6 with Xdrip and  have high capture rate



The following Mobiles have been confirmed to be working and to be reported on getting a capture rate of 90%-100%

In theory, using the same phone with the same Android version should allow you to also potentially achieve the same high capture rate. This is a guide only, it may or may not work for you. There are no guarantees on this.

**Version 1.0.0**
